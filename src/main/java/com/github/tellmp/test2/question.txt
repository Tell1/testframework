Please complete the following question. You should write clear code, copy the style
 given and provide comments where you would in a production environment.
 
* There is a basic scaffold for a Pair template class provided. Implement the rest
	of the class according to the information given in the class comment.
	
* There is a 'processing function' in Test.java. Though it functions as it should
	and produces the right output, it is incredibly slow. Speed up the function
	using some kind of multi-threading or async processing. Also replace the sort
	near the end with an STL equivalent. For the last part,	you must also use the 
	pair structure you created in the previous question. You may create new data 
	structures to help you along or improve read-ability. You may *not* modify 
	the Taco class. You may use any STL structure or function available in the JRE 
	(version 6).  I can get the processing time down to 4 seconds with 1000 tacos. 
	What can you get?
